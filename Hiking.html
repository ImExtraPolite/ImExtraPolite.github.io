            <li>Sólheimajökull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Mýrdalsjökull and is surrounded by some of Iceland’s
                most grand
                volcanoes and during summertime, a glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier only adding to the charm
                of the
                location. This popular day tour is the perfect way to get in real contact with the true reason behind
                the name Ice-land!</li>
