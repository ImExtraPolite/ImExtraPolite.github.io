        <p><b><i>Iceland</i></b> a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and ice co-exist. Where dark winters
            are offset
            by the summer's midnight sun. A country where insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.</p>

                    <li>The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name
                        for the north wind,
                        Boreas. From september to april, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow.</li>
                    <li>The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon
                        created when particles
                        emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases
                        energy, causing peculiar
                        luminous green streaks across the skies.</li>

                <p>When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's
                    namesake—namely, its 4,500
                    square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and takes place mainly
                    on the
                    Sólheimajökull and Svínafellsjökull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered
                    from Reykjavík (and
                    Skaftafell).</p>
