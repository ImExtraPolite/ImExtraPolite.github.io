        <p>THE OTHERWORLDLY AURORA borealis, or northern lights, begin high in the Earth’s atmosphere—at altitudes from
            60 to more
            than 250 miles—when charged particles from the sun become trapped in the Earth's magnetic field. The result
            is a
            colorful, dancing light show.</p>

                from 60 to more

            <li>The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica. Luckily, there are much more
                accessible places if you’d like to take in these light shows yourself. For the best seats to this
                celestial scene, consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55° and low light pollution. Find your
                magnetic latitude on NOAA and here</li>
            <br>

            <li>In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter nights are good but not
                necessarily the best
                time. Near equinoxes in March and September, the Earth’s magnetic field lets more solar particles
                interact with the
                atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal equinox in September, when there are pleasant
                temperatures in
                polar latitudes. Find the dark hours of your location</li>
